To run SKlauncher you need to have Java installed on your computer. In this guide we will show you how to install Java and SKlauncher.

## Java 17
For a long time SKlauncher has been requiring Java 8 *with JavaFX*, but not anymore. Now you can use any version of Java above 11.
We still recommend using the version of Java with **LTS** (Long-term support), which is Java 17.

### Windows
To download **Adoptium** (Temurin 17) for Windows, go to [this page](https://adoptium.net/) and click on the **Latest LTS Release** button.

1. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
2. **Make sure** to select following options in *Custom Setup* screen:
    - Add to PATH
    - Associate .jar
    - Set JAVA_HOME variable
    - JavaSoft (Oracle) registry key
3. Click on **Next** button, and then on **Install** button.
4. Wait for the installation to finish, and then click on **Finish** button.
5. If you didn't skip the *Custom Setup* screen, you can now run SKlauncher.

### Linux
To download **Adoptium** (Temurin 17) for Linux, go [this page](https://adoptium.net/) and click on the **Other platforms and versions** button. Then choose the Linux operating system, other parameters and download the latest release.

1. Extract the archive in any folder you like.
2. Create a custom Bash file to run SKlauncher using the newly downloaded JRE/JDK:
   The command in it should look something like this:
       `[PATH TO TEMURIN]/bin/java -jar [PATH TO SKLAUNCHER]`
3. If you did everything correctly you will be able to run SKlauncher by running the Bash script.

## Java 8 with JavaFX

:::danger
Support for Java 8 with JavaFX will be removed in the future. So we recommend using Java 17.
:::

:::caution
Sometimes your Java 8 may be too old to run SKlauncher. In this case, you need to update it.
:::

If for some reason you can't use Java 17, you can use Java 8 with JavaFX. To do this, you need to install Java 8 with JavaFX.
There is few ways to do this, but we recommend using [Oracle Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/), or [Liberica 8 Full JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-8-lts/).

## Common questions

### I have Java X, but the game requires Java Y, will it work?
Yes, it will work. SKlauncher downloads the game's version of Java, so you can use any version of Java on your computer.

### Why do I need Java 8 with JavaFX?
SKlauncher is built with JavaFX, which may not be included in Java 8 by default. So you need to install Java 8 with JavaFX or Java 17.

## Common issues

### I have Temurin 17 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java installed
In this situation you probably skipped the *Custom Setup* screen. To fix this, you need to reinstall Java 17,
and make sure to [follow the instructions](/getting-started/install#windows) in the *Custom Setup* screen.

### I have Liberica 8 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java 8 with JavaFX
In this situation you probably have Liberica 8 Standard Edition installed. To fix this, you need to install Liberica 8 Full JDK.
You need to download it from [here](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-8-lts/), but make sure to select **Full JDK**.
